The Console
=====

The Puppet Enterprise Console or PEC is Puppet Lab's new graphical user
console. It provides an intuitive way for systems
administrators to leverage the power of Puppet. Right out of the box, it
enables agile response and rapid scaling by locating existing resources
in the network and cloning them to new nodes, maintaining continuous
configuration management as the infrastructure expands.

Navigating the Console
-----

The Puppet Enterprise Console is primarily navigated via the menu bar
located at the top of the console.

There are nine menu items you can select from:

- Nodes

The Nodes menu is displayed by default and shows the current state of
your Puppet Enterprise environment at a glance. It displays a graph
showing the status of your Puppet runs over the last 30 days and a list
of the last nodes run. You can click on individual runs to display
detailed output including changes, log output and metrics of a specific
run.

The Nodes menu also displays the Node summary box that shows you the
state of all your managed nodes.

Enterprise ships with one group, `default`.
